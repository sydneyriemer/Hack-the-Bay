# Hack-the-Bay
My solution to Booz Allen Hamilton's Hack the Bay challenge

Python files:

data_exploration_geo.py: loads in USGS shapefiles (Peper et al., 2001) of lithogeochemical map and plots water quality data on top of map

EDA.py: spatially joins geology data and water quality data and performs exploratory data analysis of the water quality data (boxplots and hypothesis testing)

nontidal_water.py: extracts the CBP and CMC data points that only lie on land and in the states of Maryland and Virginia
